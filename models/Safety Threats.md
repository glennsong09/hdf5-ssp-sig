# HDF5 Safety Threat (Hazard) Model

The purpose of this model is to:

- **Systematically expose accident chains** (trigger → unsafe state → loss) across subsystems and threat sources.
- Drive actionable mitigations (prevention, detection, recovery, containment) and test cases.
- Align with SSP vulnerability categories to connect safety and security efforts.
- Provide practical guidance for reviewers to identify safety hazards in code changes and design.
- Maintain a living hazard register that tracks known hazards, mitigations, and verification status.

## 1) Scope and safety goals

### In scope

This model describes **how “HDF5 accidents” happen**, i.e., how non‑malicious (and sometimes malicious) triggers create **unsafe states** that lead to **losses** such as:

- data loss, corruption, silent wrong results
- file integrity loss (won’t open / opens incorrectly)
- privacy leakage via metadata, logs, artifacts
- cascading failures (one corrupted file poisons downstream pipelines)

It is **centered on the safety‑critical reality of an open HDF5 file:**

> An open HDF5 file is a **hybrid state**: some truth lives on disk, some in memory (metadata cache, chunk cache, free‑space manager), and some in-flight (VFD buffering, OS page cache, filesystem ordering).

Closed and read-only HDF5 are not immune from safety hazards, but this model is focused on open HDF5 files (that can be modified).

### Assumptions

1. **Crashes happen**: process crash, `kill -9`, node reboot, power loss, out-of-memory (OOM) kill, abort due to assertion, segfault.
2. **Write ordering is not guaranteed** unless explicitly forced: OS + filesystem + storage can reorder and delay persistence.
3. **HDF5 uses caching and delayed writes** for performance, so “API returned success” does not automatically imply “durable on disk now” unless the API/documentation says so and the VFD/FS semantics cooperate.
4. **Extensions exist** (filters, VOL connectors, VFDs, plugins) and can execute code inside the process boundary.
5. Many real deployments include **parallel I/O, threads, or distributed workflows**, which increases timing/order and other hazards.

### Primary safety goals (what we protect)

Think “assets + safety properties.”

#### Assets

- **File integrity**: HDF5 file remains parseable, consistent, and faithful to the format.
- **Data correctness**: reads return the data that was written (or the documented last-durable prefix).
- **Durability semantics**: what the user expects after `flush`/`close` is true on disk.
- **Availability**: file remains usable; recovery is possible; tooling doesn’t crash on open.
- **In-memory safety**: internal structures remain consistent; failures fail safe.
- **Privacy**: metadata and data are not leaked through side channels or artifacts.

#### Safety properties

- **Consistency**: on-disk metadata is internally consistent at defined safe points.
- **Ordering**: control actions that imply durability occur in a safe order.
- **Isolation**: extensions cannot violate core invariants silently.
- **Fail-safe behavior**: when invariants are violated, prefer *stop writing / refuse to proceed* over “continue and corrupt.”

#### Non‑goals

- This is **not** a security threat model; it’s a **safety accident model** that can incorporate security/privacy threats when they create safety losses.
- This model does **not** assume the presence of a **write‑ahead log** (WAL) or transactional semantics in HDF5 today. (See [RFC: Write-Ahead Log](https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5doc/blob/master/RFCs/HDF5_Library/WriteAheadLog/RFC_WriteAheadLog.pdf).)
- This model does **not** prescribe a single solution (WAL, checksums, copy‑on‑write, journaling, etc.). It is meant to **systematically expose accident chains** and drive requirements/tests.
- This model does **not** attempt to prove correctness; it’s designed to produce **actionable artifacts** (hazard register, unsafe control action (UCA) list, constraints, tests).

## 2) Typical accident chain (the backbone)

We model an open HDF5 file as a distributed state machine spanning

- Disk-resident state
- In-memory state
- In-flight / semi-durable state

A typical **accident chain** looks like this:

> **Trigger → Unsafe State → Loss**

### Trigger (examples)

#### A) Unintentional / environmental

- application bugs (bad call ordering, misuse of flush/close semantics)
- malformed/unexpected input file (non-malicious)
- concurrency hazards (threads, MPI, async I/O)
- resource exhaustion (disk full, memory pressure, file descriptor exhaustion)
- platform faults (power loss, reboot, kernel panic, filesystem bugs)
- storage behavior surprises (reordering, partial writes, weak flush semantics)
- operational misuse (wrong sharing mode, wrong permissions, wrong lifecycle)

#### B) Implementation defects (library + extensions)

- memory safety bugs (OOB/UAF/double free), integer overflow, undefined behavior (UB)
- missing input validation; inconsistent error handling
- logic bugs in free-space manager, cache eviction, address computations
- inadequate invariant checking prior to emitting durable bytes
- unsafe extension code executes in-process

#### C) Adversarial / malicious (relevant because HDF5 is a supply-chain “carrier”)

- malformed HDF5 files crafted to crash or corrupt tools (parsers)
- plugin/filter/VOL hijacking (load attacker-controlled code)
- trojanized binaries, compromised dependencies
- data poisoning: maliciously modified HDF5 content for downstream ML/pipelines

### Unsafe state (what makes the trigger harmful)

- on‑disk metadata becomes **inconsistent**
- in‑memory state diverges from on‑disk state with **no safe reconciliation**
- free‑space reuse or aliasing makes recovery/continuation **overwrite valid data**
- cache bookkeeping is corrupted (stale pointers, wrong sizes/addresses)
- extension boundary breaks invariants (writes unexpected bytes/offsets)
- sensitive metadata/artifacts become exposed

### Loss (what we care about)

- file won’t open; file opens but some contents are wrong
- silent data corruption (hardest class)
- lost updates (acknowledged but not durable)
- raw data overwritten due to metadata confusion
- privacy leak via metadata/logs/artifacts
- cascading failures in downstream tools/pipelines

This chain is intentionally generic so it can be applied to **each subsystem** (MDC, chunk cache, free space manager, B-tree/heap code, VFD, VOL, filters, etc.).

## 3) Practical Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA)-style taxonomy

[STPA-style analysis](https://www.ul.com/sis/blog/introduction-to-stamp-stpa-and-cast) is powerful here because HDF5 is a **control system**: controllers (application/library/subsystems) issue control actions (write/flush/free/evict/load plugin), and *unsafe actions under certain contexts produce hazards.*

### 3.1 Controllers and controlled processes (reference structure)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  C["Controller <br/> (app, pipeline, operator)"] -->|control actions| A["Actuators <br/> (HDF5 API calls, config, <br/> plugins, conversions)"]
  A --> P["Controlled process <br/> (decision / physical system)"]
  P -->|feedback| F["Feedback <br/> (validation, monitoring, <br/> provenance, tests)"]
  F --> C
```

#### Controllers

- Application code (user)
- HDF5 API layer (`H5F`/`H5D`/`H5G`…)
- Subsystems: metadata cache, free-space manager, chunk cache, object header/heap/B-tree managers
- Extension mechanisms: filters, VOL connectors, VFDs
- OS/filesystem/storage stack (implicit controller of persistence)

#### Controlled "processes"

- On-disk HDF5 state (metadata + raw data)
- In-memory state (caches, indices, bookkeeping)
- In-flight state (buffers, OS page cache, outstanding I/O)
- Artifacts (temp files, logs, plugin search paths)

#### Feedback

- return codes; error stack
- internal flags (dirty/clean, eviction pressure)
- “flush completed” signals (best-effort, depends on stack)
- file locking/sharing outcomes
- checksum/validation tool results (if any)

### 3.2 Hazard taxonomy (unsafe states)

A good hazard taxonomy is:

- **state-based** (describes unsafe condition)
- **subsystem-agnostic** (can apply anywhere)
- **mappable to SSP vulnerability categories** (later section)

| ID | Name | Description |
| -- | ---- | ----------- |
| H0 | Safety baseline: open-file hybrid state can diverge | This is not a hazard itself; it’s the underlying reality. |
| H1 | On-disk metadata inconsistency | The file’s durable metadata is not self-consistent (internal pointers, sizes, checks, graphs). |
| H2 | Hybrid divergence without a safe reconciliation path | In-memory state and on-disk state disagree and the system lacks a reliable method to converge without loss/corruption. |
| H3 | Unsafe ordering of durability-signaling actions | Operations imply durability (`flush`/`close` success), but the system allowed reorder/partial persistence that violates the implied contract. |
| H4 | Free-space aliasing / reuse hazard | Freed regions are reused while older references can still come back (via partial updates, later repair, or tool behaviors), leading to overwrites. |
| H5 | In-memory structural corruption hazard | Internal structures (cache entries, indices, lists, address maps) become corrupt, causing wrong writes, wrong reads, or unsafe frees. |
| H6 | Parser ambiguity hazard | Ambiguity or underspecified format interpretation leads to multiple valid parses or inconsistent behavior across versions/tools. |
| H7 | Extension boundary violation hazard | Extensions (filters/VOL/VFD/plugins) violate core invariants (write outside bounds, inconsistent metadata, unsafe callbacks), compromising safety. |
| H8 | Operational exposure hazard | Misconfiguration of sharing, permissions, logging, deployment, or lifecycle exposes files to unintended modification or leaks. |
| H9 | Privacy leakage hazard | Metadata, attributes, names, provenance-like structure, or embedded metadata-as-data leaks sensitive information. |
| H10 | Supply-chain artifact hazard | Unsigned/unverified builds, compromised dependencies, plugin search path hijacking introduce unsafe code/data paths. |
| H11 | Unknown/latent hazard | A placeholder category for discovered-in-audit hazards. |

### 3.3 Unsafe Control Actions (UCA) taxonomy (STPA-style)

STPA UCAs fall into 4 classic types. Here’s a **practical mapping** for HDF5:

#### UCA Types (generic)

1. **Not providing** a control action when needed
2. **Providing** a control action when not appropriate
3. **Wrong timing/order**
4. **Applied too long/too short** (stopped too soon, repeated too long)

#### Control actions to analyze (for each subsystem)

Use these as your standard UCA checklist:

##### A. Emit durable bytes

- write metadata block
- write raw data block
- update free-space structures

##### B. Signal durability

- `flush` (per-object, per-file)
- `close` / finalize
- “commit” semantic (if any higher-level layer claims it)

##### C. Manage in-memory state

- mark dirty/clean
- evict cache entry
- reuse free-space segment
- rebuild indices / lazy load

##### D. Interpret external input

- parse superblock/object header/messages
- handle malformed/edge-case structures
- accept external metadata/value sizes

##### E. Execute extension code

- load plugin/filter/VOL/VFD
- call into extension
- accept extension-produced outputs

#### UCA examples

- **UCA‑A1 (Not provided):** fail to flush critical metadata before returning success on an operation that implies persistence.
- **UCA‑A2 (Provided when not appropriate):** reuse freed region while any stale reference may still exist (from partial updates or later tool repair).
- **UCA‑A3 (Wrong order):** update pointer/reference before target block is durable (or vice versa), leaving a dangling durable reference if a crash occurs.
- **UCA‑A4 (Too short):** partial write accepted without detection; internal state assumes full write.
- **UCA‑B1:** report “flush/close success” without ensuring required ordering/durability constraints are met.
- **UCA‑C1:** evict/overwrite an in-memory structure that is still the only consistent source of truth.
- **UCA‑D1:** accept ambiguous/malformed input that leads to divergent interpretations (tool A opens, tool B corrupts).
- **UCA‑E1:** load an extension from an untrusted location; or allow extension output to violate invariants without validation.

## 5) How to use this model in practice (artifacts + workflow)

### Artifacts (what we produce)

1. **Subsystem inventory** (per component)
   - state variables: disk, memory, in-flight
   - control actions: write/flush/evict/free/parse/load extension
2. **Control structure diagram** (even a simple box/arrow diagram)
   - controllers, controlled processes, feedback channels
3. **Hazard register** (template below)
4. **UCA list** per control action (mapped to hazards)
5. **Safety constraints** (“shall” statements) derived from UCAs
6. **Test matrix**
   - crash injection points (before/after key actions)
   - malformed input cases
   - concurrency interleavings
7. **Instrumentation plan**
   - counters/tracepoints for: flush calls, write ordering assumptions, reuse events, parse errors, invariant failures
8. **Release gate**
   - every high-severity hazard must have: constraint + test + monitoring signal

### Workflow (repeat per subsystem)

1. **Define subsystem boundary** (what state you own)
2. **List control actions** (emit durable bytes, signal durability, manage memory, parse input, execute extensions)
3. **Enumerate hazards** (unsafe states)
4. **Enumerate UCAs** using the 4 UCA types
5. **Derive safety constraints** (testable “shall” statements)
6. **Design mitigations**
   - prevention (validation, ordering constraints)
   - detection (checksums, invariants)
   - recovery (repair tools, safe-mode)
   - containment (isolation/sandboxing)
   - (*optionally cite WAL-like journaling as a mitigation for crash consistency hazards*)
7. **Create tests**
   - crash injection + reopen verification
   - fuzzing + differential behavior tests
   - concurrency stress tests
8. **Operationalize**
   - document expectations (flush/close semantics)
   - add metrics/logging with privacy review

## 6) Compact safety‑threat taxonomy tuned to HDF5 accidents

A compact classifier that works well in practice:

> **Threat = Trigger × Locus × Propagation × Loss × SSP Category**

**Trigger (T):** crash/power loss, I/O error, malformed input, memory corruption, concurrency, extension execution, misconfiguration

**Locus (L):** file format parser, metadata cache, free-space manager, chunk cache, object header/B-tree/heap, VFD/VOL, filter/plugin, OS/filesystem

**Propagation (P):**

- **P0:** contained in memory (crash but no disk harm)
- **P1:** durable but detectable (checksum/invariant catches it)
- **P2:** durable and silent (worst)
- **P3:** propagates cross-file/pipeline (cascading)

**Loss (S):** unopenable, silent wrong results, lost updates, overwrite, privacy leak, availability/cascade

**SSP Category (C):** `FMT`, `LIB`, `EXT`, `TCD`, `OPS`, `PRV`, `SCD`, `UNK`

This makes incident reports and hazard entries comparable and searchable.

### Hazard register template (copy/paste)

Use this as your canonical register. It’s designed to be “STPA-friendly” (hazard ↔ UCA ↔ constraint ↔ test evidence) and SSP-aligned.

```text

## 7) Checklists (practical, subsystem-applicable)

### Checklist A — “Open-file hybrid state” review (core safety checklist)

For any subsystem, answer “yes/no”:

- **State accounting**
  - [Y/N] Do we have a clear list of in-memory state that can diverge from disk?
  - [Y/N] Do we know which operations make disk state inconsistent if interrupted?
- **Durability truth**
  - [Y/N] Which API calls imply durability? Are we sure the implementation + VFD + FS can uphold it?
  - [Y/N] Do we ever return success while durable state could still be inconsistent?
- **Ordering constraints**
  - [Y/N] Do we rely on write ordering implicitly anywhere?
  - [Y/N] Are there explicit barriers/flushes when order matters?
- **Invariant gates**
  - [Y/N] Do we validate addresses/lengths/types before writing durable bytes?
  - [Y/N] Do we fail safe on invariant failure (stop writing / return error)?
- **Recovery expectations**
  - [Y/N] After a crash, can a user/tool distinguish “possibly inconsistent” vs “known consistent”?
  - If not, do we at least fail closed (refuse to write further)?

### Checklist B — Crash consistency & partial persistence

- Have we identified **crash injection points** around:
  - [Y/N] metadata update
  - [Y/N] free-space update/reuse
  - [Y/N] index update (B-tree/heap)
  - [Y/N] flush/close boundary
- For each crash point, do we know the expected post-crash outcome?
  - [Y/N] openable?
  - [Y/N] last-durable prefix semantics?
  - [Y/N] detectable inconsistency?
- Do we have a “safe-mode open” behavior (read-only open, or strict validation) for suspicious files?
- **Optional mitigation note:** would WAL-like journaling, copy-on-write, or atomic checkpointing reduce the number of crash points that can yield durable inconsistency?

### Checklist C — File format parsing & ambiguity

- Do parsers reject malformed structures early and consistently?
- Are there ambiguous interpretations that differ across versions/tools?
- Are there size/offset calculations protected against overflow/underflow?
- Do we have differential tests (same file across versions/build options) to detect divergence?
- Do we fuzz:
  - [Y/N] superblock/object headers/messages
  - [Y/N] heap/B-tree structures
  - [Y/N] filters/encoded metadata messages?

### Checklist D — Extensions (filters/VOL/VFD/plugins)

- Do we have a **trust policy** for what code can be loaded?
- Is the plugin search path controllable, and can it be hijacked?
- Do we validate extension outputs against invariants before accepting them?
- Can extensions exfiltrate sensitive metadata through side channels or logs?
- Do we have a containment option (process isolation / sandboxing) for high-risk extensions?

### Checklist E — Privacy & artifacts

- What metadata fields might contain sensitive information (names, attributes, provenance-like structure)?
- Are logs safe by default (no sensitive dumps)?
- Are temporary artifacts (core dumps, debug traces, exported metadata) controlled?
- Do we provide guidance or tooling for redaction/anonymization?
